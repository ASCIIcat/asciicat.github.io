So it feels like I have lost some time... apparently it has been a few months. What's going on? Pc Setup, Vapes, oh my!
<!--excerpt.end-->

With all the changes at work, the move, home DIY; so much has been happening since I last actually made a post.
Well I am happily moved now, that is awesome and all settled. We have repainted the inside of the house, including feature walls.

I built a desk/battlestation of my pc.. it is awesome. I am so happy with it:

There it is all nicely set up with the lights and all, I know I have already posted this elsewhere but I still love it.

I also have stopped smoking... got a vape instead, and then another one, and then a decent mod... Well not sure if you know how this goes, but I am now really getting into this both from a DIY point of view as well as from a cloud chasing point of view.
This is my current set up:

- Asvape Michael 200W Mod
- Fireluke Freemax Tank sixtuple sub-ohm coil
- Loaded Glazed Doughnut juice (at the moment)

Other news... I have started trying to update kCuldron to MC version 1.11.2 as seen by my attempts [here](https://github.com/ASCIIcat/Contigo), it is taken from the Contigo fork as that seems to be the most recent attempt at an updated kCuldron build.

Currently I am nowhere with it just yet, still just trying to get the stupid thing to get through the initial gradle setup. I really should invest in some more time reading about gradle, really have not used it nearly enough.
