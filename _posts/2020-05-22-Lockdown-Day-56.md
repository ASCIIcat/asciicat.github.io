<!--excerpt.start-->
It has been a while since I touched this site... But I thought it was about time.
<!--excerpt.end-->

So I realised I have not touched anything related to this site since 2017, which is partly my fault and mostly that I honestly had forgotten completely about this blog all together.
So since I am in the middle of a nation-wide lockdown I may as well start recording my rather uneventful life. I have been at home for a week longer than the lockdown due to my office closing as a precaution before the national emergency lockdown was initiated.

This lockdown is due to the [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) outbreak that is currently affecting the world, here in South Africa as of today our infection count is 19'137, with a total of 369 deaths so far.
(World cases 5.01M Confirmed, 328K Deaths)

Not really the greatest news to start this up again, so I will add that I have taken up photography as a hobby and have also set up a site to record my shoots ([ASCIIcatDesigns](https://asciicatdesigns.com))
I am also looking into tattoo training, not really as a career move but more as a secondary skill.

Lastly my S.O and myself got married last year (Always save the best news for last!)
