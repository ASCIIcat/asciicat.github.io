Life has a funny way of kicking you down when things are going great.
<!--excerpt.end-->

I am no stranger to how life works, however sometimes life still manages to sneak up on me and trip me up then kick me while I am down. Just when I thought everything was finally going well again, I started to relapse. That dark feeling reached up with it's tendrils and began chewing away at my happiness.

I don't know if this is because of how distant I have been with my friends, or if it is to do with the slow week at work. Perhaps it's the fear of looming debt over my head with regards to the house I am trying to buy. But all in all, it is going to be a long lonely weekend while I reflect on all of this.

In other news, storm Dineo has finnally started touching the tip of the country. At least the weather is in my liking...
