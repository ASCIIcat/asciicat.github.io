So the ban is still carrying on...

Well the ban has not been lifted yet, there are currently multiple legal cases ongoing with regards to the ban.
I am sure they are just stalling at this point, waiting until tomorrow for more news regarding the legal battle.

In other news I have started tattooing people now, really happy with my progress so far. This lockdown has given me plenty of time to learn and practice.
Did an awesome coffee mug on my hand, really loving this ability to give myself all the micro tattoos that I want. It's very convenient haha
